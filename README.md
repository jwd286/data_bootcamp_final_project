This project was completed by Jacob Dennis in partial fulfillment of ECONGB Data Bootcamp Summer 2019. I certify that the NYU Honor Code applies to this project. In particular, I have:

Clearly acknowleged the work and efforts of others when submitting written work as their own. The incorporation of the work of others-including but not limited to their ideas, data, creative expression, and direct quotations (which should be designated by quotation marks) or a paragraphrasing therof- has been fully and appropriately referenced using notations both in text and in the bibliography. 

And I understand that:
Submitting the same or substantially similar work in multiple courses, either in the same semester or in a different semester, without the express approval of all instructors is forbidden. 

I acknowledge that the failure to abide by the NYU Stern Honor Code will result in failing grade for the project and the course


Project Description:

This exploratory project aims to look at the effects of Youtube's "Trending" algorihthm. Given that it is proprietary, we aim to analyze what kind of content is selected to be "Trending". By the company's own admission, the algoritm takes many factors into consideration including but not limited to view count, days to trend, age of the video. Along with measuring correlations by dimensions of engagement, we also aim to see what, if any, differences in performance there are between video cateogories.
